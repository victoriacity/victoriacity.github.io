## Graphics design
I design visual identification elements, including logos, for my personal projects as well as projects in my research group.

## Video channels
I am collaborating with [Paradox Interactive](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/about-us-static-info-ca.html) on *Cities: Skylines* tutorial videos. I also provided the [Chinese translation for the City Builders](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1HJ411P7bb) mini documentaries. My long-term goal on video creation is to make a channel about urban planning with a focus of road networks.

My videos are published on these channels:
* [My personal YouTube channel (English)](https://www.youtube.com/c/victoriacity74)
* [My personal BiliBili channel (Chinese)](https://space.bilibili.com/3214114)
* [Cities: Skylines official YouTube channel (English)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV9RoEcgAO1Uc7oxZGS8Lkw)
* [Cities: Skylines official BiliBili channel (Chinese)](https://space.bilibili.com/390890336/)

## Posters
I treat my posters presented at academic conferences as works of graphics design as well. Compared with figures in research articles, poster needs to be more visually efficient in the use of graphical schemes and illustrations because of the dense environment of poster sessions, both in-person and virtual.

## Scientific illustrations
I provide scientific illustrations for chemistry and materials science research as well as my own research articles. My illustrations have been published on top scientific journals including *Nature Communications*, *Journal of the American Chemical Society*, and *Chemical Science*.

## Earlier work
I was the Director of Visual Design at [Wuhan University Student Union](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3p8R77SooQxpujAYByu2Nw) in 2015--2016, during which I performed and supervised the graphics design for student events. Below are some of the design works I have done at Wuhan University or under my supervision. For those who attend college in the US, the "Student Union" is equivalent to Council of Undergraduate Students.
